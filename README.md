#Mind-Mot

##User Story

As a user, I want to have all my essential wellbeing routine in one place. I will inspire myself with a daily quote, have myself thinking of a few things I am grateful for and write it down to my journal provided,then have a browse for some food and/or drink of the day in eat section and finally will turn on a sleep video for unwinding. 

##Description

The idea behind creating Mind-MOT is to have an app which comprises all aspects of personal wellbeing into one easy to use website. The dashboard contains seperate sections divided into fields of interest such as food, relaxation, sleep and gratitude where the user can find related information and activities. The application is responsive and mobile friendly.
